In this project, you will be developing a file-sharing server. A file share server is a computer or server that enables multiple users on a network to access and share files and folders in a central location. It allows users to access files on various devices. You will create a server file system simulator to store all the files created by clients.

This repository contains two projects: the client and the server. You only need to modify the server.

Runtime instructions:
1. Cd to your fileServer folder: ./Desktop/DONE-file-sharing-server-the-executor-c-s-Testing-branch\ 2\ copy/FileServer/
2. Compile your main file: javac src/main/java/ca/concordia/**/*.java
3. Start your local hosted server: java -cp src/main/java ca.concordia.Main
4. Open a new terminal
5. Link to your server (port should be = 12345): nc localhost 12345
